## Usage
Use the operator interface in a web browser at `localhost` to move items between locations:

Or record production operations, which consume one item to make another:

View the dashboard in a web browser at `localhost:8000` to see where items currently are:

Items can be either of a 'type', of which a fungible quantity is at a location, or alternatively items can be 'individual' and have a unique reference number and can only be in one place at once.  

## Barcode Scanners
Barcode scanners attached to the pi can be configured to be associated with a location. When an 'individual' item is scanned, it is moved to the location associated with the barcode scanner.  
Product types cannot be directly moved via barcode scanners, but instead the barcode scanners could be used with the web forms to reduce typing of product numbers.
